The merchant can view a list of catalogues, and each item has three actions:

1. `"Stock" - This action allows the merchant to update the stock quantity of the item.` 

2.  `"Waiting List" - By selecting this action, the merchant can access the waiting list orders. From there, they can either cancel or update the order as needed. `
3. `"All Orders" - This action enables the merchant to view all orders. The "All Orders" section for the merchant can be further categorized into three groups: Active Orders (Confirmed, Partially Confirmed, Waiting List), Inactive Orders (Cancelled, Completed), and All Orders (including both active and inactive orders) Within this section, the merchant can mark orders as completed or cancel order.`
